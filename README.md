# HB_FINAL_TASK2
CSS is a layout model for dynamically arranging elements in a container. float and inline-block are old and require a lot of code, but using flexbox allows the user to arrange, distribute, and center elements together in a convenient way. 

justify-content: used for alignment along the main axis. align-item: used for alignment along the border axis. align-self: used for right alignment for individual flex items. 

flex-direction:row for column, flex-direction:column for column 

according to flex container: display:flex, flex-direction:column or row, justify-content:center, according to flex item: align-self, flex:..., order:1 

flex-grow:
This property specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items inside the container when there is available space.
flex-shrink:
This property specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items inside the container when there is not enough space.
flex-basis:
This property specifies the initial size of a flex item before any growing or shrinking occurs. It can be a length value (e.g., 100px, 50%), or auto (which uses the item's content size).
